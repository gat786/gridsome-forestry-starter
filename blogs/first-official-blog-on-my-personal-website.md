title: First official blog on my personal website
excerpt: This is for testing out Forestry.io's CMS system

---
This is my First Ever Blog here.   
I am writing here this to just test out how CMS systems work and whether it will work or not because i was wanting to do this for a while now but wasn't able to do it because of simple and very tricky to solve bugs which I was facing down the lines.   
  
If this works out well then I will write a blog on how to do this yourself with the least costs and ease.  
  
I will try to put an image over here just to check whether it will work as expected or not.

Including a code block just to see how it will look when I officially start blogging over here and you guys start consuming the content which I write.

    print("Hello Guys")
    print("its been fun working with you all")

Let's see how it will look if I try to embed a gist here.
